            <h2>SudokGO Overview and Rules</h2>
            <p>SudokGO is a Sudoku web app with single player and multiplayer(Battle Mode) functionality. The objective of a Sudoku game is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits 1 to 9 so that each column, row, and each of the nine 3x3 sub-grids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. Therefore, there cannot be any repeat digits in a column, row or sub-grid.</p>

                <h4>Single Player</h4>
                <p>Our application first provides a user with the options of playing an easy, medium, or hard single player Sudoku game.  Once the user chooses the difficulty, the Sudoku board will be filled and the timer will start.  The goal for the user is to finish the Sudoku puzzle as fast as possible.  While playing the game, a user can undo/redo a move.  A user also can pause the game, which stops the timer and makes the board disappear so that the player is not given an unfair advantage when the timer is stopped.  We also allow the user to switch between numbers and marks while filling in the board.  The marks are smaller numbers that can be used as notes if the user is unsure of a few numbers that could be placed in one box.</p>

                <p>Once a single player user completes a game, the user can enter their name, which will be put on a leaderboard if their time is one of the top ten times.</p>

        <!--We also allow battle mode in our application, which is a multiplayer version of Sudoku.  If the user plays in battle mode, they will be given a link to send to their friends.  Once their friend has joined the game by going to the link, our application asks them if they are ready.  Once both players are ready, the multiplayer game starts where the goal is to finish the same Sudoku puzzle faster than their opponent.  If a player puts the correct number in a box, then the other player will know as the box on their screen will be highlighted in yellow.  This increases the intensity of the game for players because they know how far along their opponent is.-->
